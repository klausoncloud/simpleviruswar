					<p>So here is a little game under development. It is 4 viruses
						fighting each other in a small memory space. You can pick which
						algorithm to use for each virus, then start a run and see who
						survives.</p>
					<p>It is quite possible to get a stable scenario, with two or
						more viruses surviving. So the game is limited to 500 rounds.</p>
					<p>You can add player(s) to the game, too. Right now, only for
						your own game and only temporarily. The additional players are
						stored in your browser only. On page reload, you have to resubmit.

						<summary>Requirements and specification of custom
							players.</summary>

						<p>A player has to be a public HTTP address (URL). The game
							server will call the following methods:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>GET /startGame query parameters: int boardX, int boardY,
								int numPlayers, int playerId <br> Expected return is a JSON
								object depicting a SPAWN move. See below. There is no penalty
								for returning a different move. But not spawning on the first
								move means that there is no piece for the player on the board,
								and consequently the player has lost the game after the first
								round. Not likely that you want this. <br> Example:
								http://&lt;yourUrl&gt;/startGame?boardX=40&amp;boardY=20&amp;numPlayers=4&amp;playerId=3
							</li>
							<li>GET /nextMove query parameters: none <br> Expected
								return is JSON object depicting any legal move. See below.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Your methods need to return a JSON object as plain text.
							The JSON needs to be { fromX : int, fromY : int, toX: int, toY:
							int, moveType: string }. Where:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>fromX, fromY, toX, toY are numbers within the dimensions
								of the board.</li>
							<li>moveType is any of the following: SPAWN, MOVE, PASS,
								FIRE
								<ul>
									<li>SPAWN - Your player places another piece on the board
										at location toX/toY. Parameters fromX and fromY will be
										ignored. Any piece already on the board at location toX/toY
										will be removed (even if it is a piece owned by your player).
										This is a costly move. Your player will be skipped for 5
										rounds.</li>
									<li>FIRE - Your player fires at the location toX/toY.
										Parameters fromX and fromY will be ignored. Any piece on the
										board at location toX/toY will be removed (even if it is a
										piece owned by your player). This is a cheap move. Your player
										will not be skipped.</li>

									<li>MOVE - Your player moves a piece from location
										fromX/fromY to toX/toY. Any piece on the board at location
										toX/toY will be removed (even if it is a piece owned by your
										player). This is a somewhat costly move. Your player will be
										skipped for 2 rounds.</li>
									<li>PASS - Your player passes. Likely not a good idea, but
										possible. This is a cheap move. Your player will be not be
										skipped.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Any illegal move will be considered a PASS.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Yes. Right now it is that simple and not all of the
							parameters are actually useful. But there is more to come. Plan
							here is to add methods informing your player of moves submitted
							by other players. So, your player can learn and adjust, strategy
							or tactics, if you like.</p>
